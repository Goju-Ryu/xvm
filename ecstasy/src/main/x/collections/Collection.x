/**
 * A Collection is a container data structure that represents a group of _values_. There are a
 * number of generic capabilities and loose contracts defined by the Collection interface itself,
 * and specialization (with additional contractual constraints and clarifications) in several
 * derived interfaces, including:
 * * The Set interface defines a container for distinct values;
 * * The List interface defines a sequence of values.
 *
 * Collections are very common data structures. As with many data structures, it is expected that
 * implementations will support one or more of these four modes, whose general behaviors are
 * defined as:
 * * A *mutable* collection is one that allows items to be added and removed, and whose contents are
 *   generally not required to be immutable. If an implementation provides support for more than one
 *   mode, including a *mutable* mode, then it should implement the {@link MutableAble} interface.
 * * A *fixed size* collection is one that does not allow items to be added or removed, but whose
 *   values can be replaced, and whose contents are generally not required to be immutable.
 *   Requesting a persistent collection to add or remove contents will result in a new fixed
 *   size collection as a result of the request. If an implementation provides support for more than
 *   one mode, including a *fixed size* mode, then it should implement the {@link FixedSizeAble}
 *   interface.
 * * A *persistent* collection is one that does not allow items to be added or removed, whose values
 *   can not be replaced, but whose contents are generally not required to be immutable. Requesting
 *   a persistent collection to add, remove, or modify its contents will result in a new persistent
 *   collection as a result of the request. If an implementation provides support for more than one
 *   mode, including a *persistent* mode, then it should implement the {@link PersistentAble}
 *   interface.
 * * A *const* collection is one that is immutable, whose size and contents are immutable, and which
 *   provides a new *const* collection as the result of any mutating request. If an implementation
 *   provides support for more than one mode, including a *const* mode, then it should implement the
 *   {@link ImmutableAble} interface.
