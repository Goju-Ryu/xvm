# Directory: ./.github/ #

This directory used by [GitHub](https://github.com/), holds data necessary 
for different services provided by them. The files in this directory and its 
subdirectories have no effect on the project. They only affect how GitHub 
handles the repository, and the automated actions that GitHub performs.

Folder: `./workflows/`  
This folder contains workflow files. These files describe a Github Actions 
[workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow).
These are helpful for continuous integration and automated testing among other things.
