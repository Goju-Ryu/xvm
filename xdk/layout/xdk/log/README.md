This directory will contain any error logs generated from the
command line tools. A developer using the XDK can choose to
submit these logs back to the Ecstasy project online,
which allows those errors to be identified and fixed.

(The tool that allows a developer to sanitize and upload
logs in order to report an issue with the XDK is not yet available.)
