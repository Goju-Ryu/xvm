# Directory: ./tests/ #

This directory contains JUnit unit tests. Some are current; others (unfortunately) not.

Once the "reflection" project (WIP) is done, and as we boot-strap prototype code into natural Ecstasy code, this directory will probably go away, and unit + functional tests will be created in the `./xsrc/` directory instead. (Reflection is required to build an Ecstasy CI harness.)
